            This page was generated by GitHub Pages using the Cayman theme by Jason Long.
                  I decided to go with Github and Github Pages to create my own custom website.
                  A friend suggested to me to use Github and I see it as a valuable opportunity 
                  to learn both Git and GUI programming.  I learn best by example and this creates
                  all the material I need to study and understand HTML and CSS. 
            
            CHANGELOG:
            9/22/15:  Created Change log.  Modified Text for the webpage.

            <p>My name is Zachary Wong.  I decided to use GitHub Pages and its various templates as my base for my site.  I am currently using codeacadamy and w3 to learn HTML and CSS.</p>

                <a id="goals-in-mind" class="anchor" href="#goals-in-mind" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals in Mind</h3>

            <p>The goal here is for me to examine and learn the structure of a website.  This template also uses pre-made CSS files to stylize this page.  I want to create a website for my YouTube Channel where I can share all my sheet music and arrangements for free.  I also need to make an "about" and "contact" page.</p>

                <a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Support or Contact</h3>
