    This page was generated by GitHub Pages using the Cayman theme by Jason Long.
          I decided to go with Github and Github Pages to create my own custom website.
          A friend suggested to me to use Github and I see it as a valuable opportunity 
          to learn both Git and GUI programming.  I learn best by example and this creates
          all the material I need to study and understand HTML and CSS. -->

<p>My name is Zachary Wong.  to start off, I decided to use GitHub Pages and its various templates as my base for my site.</p>

<a id="goals-in-mind" class="anchor" href="#goals-in-mind" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals in Mind</h3>

<p>The goal here is for me to examine and learn the structure of a webpage through it's code.  I learn best when I have examples to go by.  I am very excited about this year!  This template also uses pre-made CSS files to stylize this page.</p>
