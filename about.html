            91.461 Assignment:  Creating Your First Web Page

            This page was generated by GitHub Pages using the Cayman theme by Jason Long.
                  I decided to go with Github and Github Pages to create my own custom website.
                  A friend suggested to me to use Github and I see it as a valuable opportunity 
                  to learn both Git and GUI programming.  I learn best by example and this creates
                  all the material I need to study and understand HTML and CSS. 
            
            CHANGELOG:
            9/22/15:  Created Change log.  Modified Text for the webpage.

            <p>I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science major at UMass Lowell with a minor in Sound Recording Technology.  My field of concentration is graphic user interfaces.
               I've done contracted database work for UMass Lowell, Town of Framingham, and Natick Army Base.
               <br><br>Most recently I was contracted to work with a consumer science and
               statistics team at Natick Army Research and Development Labs.  That contract lasted for the duration of the summer.
               <br>I also have done work with the Town of Framingham implementing the school curriculum to an online learning interface called itLearning.com.  I still regularly do work for the Town of Framingham.
               <br>While in classes during fall and spring, I am a grader for the Computing I taught by Dr. Adams.  I've been one of Dr. Adam's grader since last fall in 2014 grading C and C++ assignments.
